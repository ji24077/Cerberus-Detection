# Cerberus-Detection

## Project Overview
Cerberus-Detection is the final project for APS360: Applied Fundamentals of Deep Learning at the University of Toronto. This project focuses on developing a deep learning model capable of differentiating between AI-generated and human-generated text. This distinction is crucial for verifying the authenticity of digital content in various fields including academia and media.

## Features
- **AI Text Detection**: Utilizes advanced RNN architectures to accurately determine the origin of the text, whether it is generated by an AI or a human.
- **Model Accuracy**: Through continuous refinement of model architecture and hyperparameters, the project has achieved an accuracy increase from 49% to 86.49%.
- **Data Management**: Efficient data handling and storage techniques ensure optimal training, validation, and testing processes.

## Team Members
- **Vivian Huynh**: vivian.huynh@mail.utoronto.ca

## Project Structure
- **Data Processing**: Detailed steps including data cleaning, preprocessing, and splitting to ensure the data is model-ready.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to handle the complexities of textual data. *(In the future, we are considering/testing more architectures.)*
- **Training and Validation**: Systematic approach to model training with a split of 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing. *(So far.)*

## Ethical Considerations
The project acknowledges the ethical implications of AI text detection and strives to minimize false positives which could potentially have serious repercussions for individuals. Moreover, the team considers the bias potential due to data collection methods and aims for a transparent, fair model evaluation.

## Collaboration and Project Management
The project is a collaborative effort among students, facilitated by weekly meetings and continuous integration practices using GitHub for version control and task tracking.
